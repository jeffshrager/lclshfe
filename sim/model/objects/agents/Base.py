"""The agents represented in the model

In the model, there are three primary agents responsible for the operation of the
instrument. The Operator is directly in controll of the beamline of the instrument.
The Data Analyst observes the AMI and determines when the data is good enough to
stop the run as well as gives updates to the Experiment Manager when there is a problem.
The Experiment Manager is responsible for the overall control of the experiment and
communicates with both the Operator and the Data Analyst to understand the state of 
the Experiment as well as make changes at a high level to improve the quality and
efficiency of the experiment.

  Typical usage example:

  DA = DataAnalyst()
  DA.check_if_enough_data_to_analyse(context)

  bar = foo.FunctionBar()
